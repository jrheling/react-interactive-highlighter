# Static Highligher Example

This is a simple CRA demo that shows how to use `react-interactive-highligher` to display text containing pre-defined highlights.

For a simple demo, simply run `yarn start`.

Note: The parent tree uses some newer package versions than CRA does out of the box, so it might be necessary to start this with `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true yarn start`.
